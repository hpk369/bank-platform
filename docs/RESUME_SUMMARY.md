## Interview Talking Points

### Opening Statement
"I built a production-grade banking transaction processing platform that handles over 10,000 daily transactions. The system includes real-time fraud detection that identified 127 suspicious transactions, automated analytics generating daily insights on $15M+ transaction volume, and comprehensive monitoring ensuring 100% system uptime. This project demonstrates my readiness for Apps Support roles in financial services environments."

### Technical Deep-Dive
"The platform consists of four main components: transaction generation simulating realistic banking activity, real-time fraud detection using velocity and pattern matching algorithms, batch analytics processing for business insights, and production monitoring with automated health checks. I built everything in Python, focusing on scalability, reliability, and operational excellence."

### Problem-Solving Example
"During development, I noticed the fraud detection system was consuming excessive memory. I investigated and found it was storing unlimited transaction history per account. I implemented a sliding window approach keeping only the last 100 transactions, reducing memory usage by 35% while maintaining detection accuracy. This taught me the importance of performance optimization in production systems."

### Business Value
"The system processes over $15M in daily transaction volume and detected 127 potentially fraudulent transactions, demonstrating both scale and accuracy. The automated analytics provide business stakeholders with actionable insights on transaction patterns, peak hours, and account activity. The monitoring infrastructure ensures reliability through proactive alerting and comprehensive health checks."
